# Working notes for agents

Read this first, then `.agent_tasks/QUEUE.md` for what to pick up next, then
`ROADMAP.md` for where the work stands.

## What this is

<One paragraph: what the project does and why it exists.>

`ROADMAP.md` owns the phase list and its status. `.agent_tasks/QUEUE.md` owns
which task is next, and each `.agent_tasks/<task>/STATE.md` owns the steps of
work in flight. This file owns the purpose, ground rules and traps. Do not
restate a phase's status here.

## Ground rules

<The failure mode of this project, as numbered rules. What must never happen -
data loss, privacy leaks, writing to a live file? These hold for every phase.>

## Running things

<Entry points and the commands worth running, one per line with a one-line
comment.>

## Traps

<Append as they are hit - the ones that cost real time, written so the next
session does not repeat them.>

## The task workspace - read before starting work

`.agent_tasks/` holds the state of work in progress, so the plan does not die
with the session. The full contract is `.agent_tasks/README.md`, the template
`.agent_tasks/_template/STATE.md`. The short version:

1. **Read `.agent_tasks/QUEUE.md` first**, then the `STATE.md` of any task
   that is not `done`. If the queue is empty, fall back to `ROADMAP.md`. Do
   not open a second task while one is `in progress` unless the user asks.
2. **Progress is the checklist.** Tick a step only when it is finished *and
   verified*. Never delete a step: tick it, or move it to *Deferred or
   blocked* with the reason.
3. **Long output goes to `.agent_tasks/<task>/scratch/`**, which is
   gitignored, so any conclusion drawn from it must end up in `STATE.md`, or
   in `ROADMAP.md` if it is a measurement.
4. **Update `STATE.md` as state changes**, especially its *Where it stopped*
   line. Append a row to `.agent_tasks/efficiency_stats.md` before stopping.

A `STATE.md` step is a step of the work; a roadmap item is product state.
When a step lands and moves a roadmap item, tick both in the same commit.

## Assume this is the last prompt of the session

Sessions end without warning. Work accordingly:

- **Update `ROADMAP.md` when a phase item changes state**, in the same commit
  as the change.
- **When a measurement is taken, write the number down** where the roadmap
  keeps its findings. A superseded number is useful; a missing one is not.
- **Commit in coherent local groups** and never push without the user's
  explicit request.
- **If about to run low, stop and write rather than start something new.**
  Half-finished unverified code is worse than a documented gap.

## Verifying a change

<The commands that prove a change is sound - syntax check, then the cheapest
command that exercises real behaviour. Name them once so each session does not
rediscover them.>
